About:

This game is the brain child of one of my teammates during the Advanced Programming Seminar class of Fall 2019.
We wanted to make a game that was simple on the outside, and complex on the inside. The genre was comedic Modern/Medieval hack and slash.
Which is why there are random pictures and inspirations of our professors as bosses and the main menu being our inititial level design.
You play either alone or with a friend in local coop, to traverse the levels collecting coins from the local people
in order to pay your parking meter. Along the way, there will be bosses that you can fight and gain coins, which can be
used in the Secret Shop for upgrades.
